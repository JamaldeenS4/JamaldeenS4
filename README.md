# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My Coding Lab

This is my **sandbox account** â€” a place for small projects, class exercises, and experiments while I learn software engineering.

### ðŸ§  Currently Learning
- **Python** â€“ fundamentals, scripting, and building small applications  
- **Java** â€“ fundamentals and object-oriented programming  
- **Backend Development** â€“ building APIs and server-side logic  
- **Full-Stack Pathway** â€“ combining front-end, backend, and databases  
  

### ðŸ“‚ Repositories
Most projects here are for practice and personal growth.  
My main professional GitHub (coming soon) will contain polished portfolio projects.
